# ELife_MovieTuning
Code and datasets generated and needed to reproduce results in upcoming ELife paper

The main function to generate figures is called "Movie_Tuning_FigCreator_v24_June20_2023.m". This script relies on the SupporingScripts and DataFiles which are also provided. This code has been tested on MATLAB v2020a, and requires the CircStat 2012 toolbox. All other necessary files should be present, but please do not hesitate to open an issue if you encounter errors. 

In addition to these files, the raw dataset from Allen Brain Institute can be obtained at - http://api.brain-map.org//
The full URLs which can be used for downloads can be found through their website, or from the .csv file "sessions"
